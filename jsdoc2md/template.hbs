# gulp-chrome-manifest-iconify

A [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin for
[chrome-manifest-iconify](https://github.com/Steven-Roberts/chrome-manifest-iconify)

When creating a Chrome extension or app, you need to provide a set of icons for
context menus, browser actions, page actions, and the Chrome Web Store. Usually,
these are just resized versions of the same image. The goal of
gulp-chrome-manifest-iconify is to intellegently automate the tedious process of
generated all these resized clones. In a [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
task, simply pipe this plugin a master icon and indicate the path to a v2
manifest. It will parse the manifest to determine the sizes, names, types, and
paths of the icons it needs to generate. You can choose from several resizing
algorithms as provide by [JIMP](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp) so your
entire icon set looks awesome.
